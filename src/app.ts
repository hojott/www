    <p>
      I am Kussi "Sakari" Marttinen and I don't like frontend. I did however create this veri great website for you to enjoy,
      as I got tired of seeing a 404 when I tried going to my website. It was created with Vite so I had to put veri low effort
      and it doesn't even have any vulnerabilities! (100% cybersecure!) </p>

      If you are a jobperson please don't listen to me too closely and insted watch this cat gif I added (with my veri big skills)
